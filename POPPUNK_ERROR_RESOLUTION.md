# PopPUNK Error Resolution - Complete Fix

## Error Encountered
```
ERROR ~ Error executing process > 'POPPUNK (PopPUNK_clustering)'
Process `POPPUNK (PopPUNK_clustering)` terminated with an error exit status (1)

Command error:
Input reference list is misformatted
Must contain sample name and file, tab separated
```

## Root Cause Analysis
PopPUNK version 2.7.5 requires input files to be in a specific tab-separated format:
- **Column 1**: Sample name (without file extension)
- **Column 2**: Full path to FASTA file
- **Separator**: Tab character (not spaces)

The original script was creating a simple list of file paths, which PopPUNK couldn't parse correctly.

## Solution Implemented

### Before (Incorrect)
```bash
# Only provided file paths
echo "$(pwd)/$file" >> assembly_list.txt
```

**Result**: Single column with file paths
```
/path/to/sample1.fasta
/path/to/sample2.fasta
```

### After (Correct)
```bash
# Extract sample name and create tab-separated format
sample_name=$(basename "$file" | sed 's/\.[^.]*$//')
echo -e "$sample_name\t$(pwd)/$file" >> assembly_list.txt
```

**Result**: Tab-separated format with sample names
```
sample1	/path/to/sample1.fasta
sample2	/path/to/sample2.fasta
```

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Sample Name Extraction**:
   - Uses `basename` to get filename without path
   - Uses `sed 's/\.[^.]*$//'` to remove file extension
   - Works with .fasta, .fa, and .fas extensions

2. **Proper Tab Separation**:
   - Uses `echo -e` to enable escape sequence interpretation
   - Uses `\t` for tab character
   - Ensures proper column separation

3. **Enhanced Debugging**:
   - Added output showing first few entries
   - Helps verify format is correct
   - Makes troubleshooting easier

4. **Maintained Compatibility**:
   - Works with all supported file extensions
   - Preserves all original functionality
   - No changes to downstream processes

## Verification

### Test Results
✅ **Format Test Passed**: Tab-separated format correctly generated  
✅ **Sample Names**: Properly extracted without extensions  
✅ **File Paths**: Full paths correctly included  
✅ **Pipeline Syntax**: Validated successfully  

### Expected Behavior
With 132 assembly files, PopPUNK should now:
1. Successfully parse the tab-separated input file
2. Create the database with all 132 samples
3. Fit the clustering model
4. Assign cluster IDs to each sample
5. Generate clusters.csv output file

## Files Updated
- `nextflow_tapir_poppunk_snp.nf` - Fixed POPPUNK process script
- `README.md` - Added PopPUNK troubleshooting section
- `POPPUNK_FIX.md` - Technical details of the fix

## Next Steps
1. **Re-run the pipeline** - The PopPUNK step should now complete successfully
2. **Monitor progress** - Check that clustering completes and generates clusters.csv
3. **Verify output** - Ensure cluster assignments are reasonable for your dataset

The pipeline is now ready to handle your 132 assembly files correctly!
